To load the pretrained AlexNet network into MATLAB and examined its structure. 
It can predict the content of a 227-by-227 color image from 1000 possible categories.

% This code imports AlexNet. %

deepnet = alexnet;

%Save layers%

ly = deepnet.Layers

%Extract first layer%

inlayer = ly(1)

%Extract input size%

insz = inlayer.InputSize

%Extract last layer%

outlayer = ly(end)

%Extract class names%

categorynames = outlayer.Classes
